    Why I made "Show Love"?
    
  </h2>
  
  
  I made show love to....well..SHOW LOVE. I think showing love and expecting nothing is good for the soul and
  betters us as people so what better way to show love and expect nothing than sending a completely anonymous text from
  the Show Love website to someone you care about or even a random person?
